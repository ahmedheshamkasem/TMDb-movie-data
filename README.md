# TMDb-movie-data
(cleaned by  udacity  from original data on Kaggle) - Investigate a Dataset


This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.  

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.  
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.  
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.  

Get Organized  
Eventually, you’ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:  
The report communicating your findings  
Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis  
The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)  
You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook.  


Analyze Your Data  
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions.  
Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!  


Share Your Findings  
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.
